Different ontologies have different terms/codes to depict the same cancer sub-type. {oncotree_code} is the OncoTree code that is the same as {ncit_code} (NCIt) and {umls_code} (UMLS). Use these codes to gather as much literature/data as possible to provide a comprehensive list of genes in JSON structured format. The associated gene list should be ranked by strength and likelihood of association such that the first gene in the list has the strongest association with the cancer type and the last gene in the list has the weakest association with the cancer type. The gene list should be of high quality, accurate, and should not exceed 50 in count. The JSON should have top-level keys:

'gene_info' is a dictionary with keys and values formatted as follows: 1. 'association_strength', value: classified as 'very strong', 'strong', 'moderate', 'weak', or 'very weak' association of this particular gene and cancer type depending on the quality and quantity of resources used to associate the gene and cancer type, 2. 'reference', value: resource(s) used to infer the gene-cancer type association (if multiple, then separate by '|'), 3. 'mutations', value: list of types of mutations in the gene that is associated with the given cancer type (such as truncating, splice, missense gain of function, missense-loss of function, missense-neomorphic, missense-hypo-/hyper-morphic, deletion, duplication, fusion, copy number variant, structural variant, complex rearrangements, methylation, and so on relevant to the gene-cancer type association), 4. 'mutation_origin', value: MUST be either "germline/somatic" OR "somatic" where 'germline/somatic' indicates that the cancer mutation in this gene can be present in the germline as cancer predisposing or arise somatically over time (so includes both 'germline' and 'somatic' options in 1 category only), 'somatic' indicates that the cancer mutation in this gene is only of somatic origin and not seen in the germline, 5. 'diagnostic_implication', value: clinical implication of the gene as to whether it is used to diagnose the cancer type, for example, the gene KRAS is associated with PAAD: 'diagnostic: missense mutations in KRAS are associated with PAAD and used for diagnosis.' Limit to 1 sentence, 6. 'therapeutic_relevance', value: if gene mutation informs decision making for therapeutic strategy, for example, for the association of KRAS and PAAD, 'clinical trials such as NCT07020221 are actively testing inhibitors of the actionable missense mutation KRAS G12D which is frequent in PAAD. Effect on immunotherapy is ....'),
